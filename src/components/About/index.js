    <p> If you find this website helpful, please consider donating.
    It was conceived, written and launched entirely by one queer kid who saw a need, had an idea, and really hates trying to attach a price to their work.
    That kid likes to be able to eat, would really like to have health insurance, and someday would like to take a legit vacation. Also, assuming this is successful, they're likely going to have to pay firebase something eventuall and the domain is roughly 12 bucks a year.
    So really... if this is useful to you, and/or you want it to persist/grow, throw me some bones.
    Every dollar helps.
    Thanks!
